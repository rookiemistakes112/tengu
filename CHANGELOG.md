## [Unreleased] — Timeout Resilience and Scan Accuracy Fixes

### Fixed

**Timeout handling discarded all partial output (`executor/process.py`)**
- `run_command()` used a single `asyncio.wait_for(proc.communicate())` call. Cancelling that
  call on timeout tore down the subprocess's pipe transport, so any output already produced
  before the kill was lost — every timed-out scan returned nothing, even if the tool had
  found real results seconds before the timeout fired. Redesigned around independent
  background drain tasks (`_drain()`) that read `proc.stdout`/`proc.stderr` continuously and
  are never cancelled; on timeout, only `proc.wait()` is cancelled and the process is killed,
  then the drain tasks are awaited to completion so whatever was already written is kept.
  `ScanTimeoutError` now carries `partial_stdout`/`partial_stderr` so callers can salvage
  results instead of getting nothing. Verified with a new real-subprocess test
  (`test_timeout_preserves_partial_stdout`) — the naive "call `communicate()` again after
  `kill()`" fix was tried first and failed this same test (returned empty), which is what
  led to the drain-task redesign.

**nikto (`tools/web/nikto.py`) silently discarded 100% of its findings**
- `-Format json -output /dev/stdout` produces no output at all on this nikto build (2.6.0) —
  confirmed by testing 3 flag variations directly against the binary. Removed the JSON
  output flags entirely and rewrote `_parse_nikto_output` to parse nikto's plain-text
  output, matching only bracketed-ID finding lines (`^\+\s*\[(?P<id>[^\]]+)\]\s*(?P<rest>.*)$`)
  instead of also capturing metadata lines as false findings.
- Also catches `ScanTimeoutError` and salvages `exc.partial_stdout` into a
  `{"timed_out": True, ...}` result instead of losing the scan entirely — nikto's own
  scan time (measured live: 322–323s at a misconfig+file-retrieval tuning) regularly
  exceeded the timeout it used to run under.

**ffuf (`tools/web/ffuf.py`) silently reported 0 results on every scan**
- `_parse_ffuf_output` parsed ffuf's `-json` output as a single JSON blob
  (`json.loads(output)`), but ffuf actually streams NDJSON (one JSON object per line) — this
  threw `JSONDecodeError` on any scan with more than one match, caught by a bare
  `except: pass`, so ffuf reported "0 endpoints discovered" even when it found real results
  (verified directly against the raw binary: `/config`, `/docs`, `/external`, `.htaccess`).
  Rewrote to parse line-by-line. Also added `_decode_fuzz_input()` — ffuf 2.1.0-dev
  base64-encodes the `FUZZ` input field in its NDJSON output, previously passed through
  un-decoded. Same `ScanTimeoutError` partial-result salvage as nikto.

**hydra (`tools/bruteforce/hydra.py`) — form-based login attacks were unsupported, and credential parsing never matched real output**
- `_SUPPORTED_SERVICES` was missing `http-get-form`/`https-get-form`. Added, alongside new
  `form_path`/`form_params` parameters — Hydra's `*-form` modules need a single positional
  module argument in `"<path>:<post_data>:<failure_string>"` syntax that `hydra_attack` had
  no way to supply before. Validates both are present when the service is a `-form` variant;
  CRLF/NUL-stripped before being joined (no shell involved — `create_subprocess_exec`, not
  `shell=True` — but stray CRLF could still corrupt Hydra's own arg parsing or spoof audit
  log lines).
- `_parse_hydra_output`'s regex (`r"\[.+?\]\s+login:..."`) never matched real Hydra v9.7
  output, which has a `host: HOST` segment between the port/service brackets and `login:`
  that the old pattern didn't account for — `valid_credentials_found` was silently always 0
  regardless of what Hydra actually found. Fixed to match the same structure Hellfire's own
  (already-correct) `auth_failures_agent.py` parser uses. Verified live against DVWA: a real
  crack (`admin` / a wordlist password) now correctly reports
  `valid_credentials_found: 1` with the credential populated, instead of 0.

**sqlmap (`tools/injection/sqlmap.py`) discarded all findings on timeout**
- `sqlmap_scan` re-raised on `ScanTimeoutError` instead of catching it, unlike
  nikto.py/ffuf.py (fixed above in this same release) — a scan that ran out of time lost
  every parameter sqlmap had already confirmed vulnerable. Now catches `ScanTimeoutError`
  and salvages `exc.partial_stdout` into a `{"timed_out": True, ...}` result, same pattern
  as nikto/ffuf. Hellfire's `injection_agent.py` runs sqlmap at `level=3, risk=2` against
  live targets, which had already been observed exceeding Tengu's 600s default timeout on
  a real site — see Hellfire's own CHANGELOG, 2026-08-10 entry.

### Known follow-up (not fixed here)
- Live-verifying the hydra fix above against DVWA's login form surfaced a separate,
  pre-existing accuracy issue: Hydra reported a *wrong* password (not the real DVWA default)
  as valid. Root cause looks like DVWA's login CSRF token requirement causing some
  failed-login responses to not contain the configured failure string, which Hydra then
  reads as success. This is a target/form-behavior issue, not a Tengu parsing bug — the
  regex fix above correctly parses whatever Hydra reports — but it means `hydra_attack`
  results against CSRF-protected forms should be treated as needing manual confirmation
  until this is investigated further.
- The sqlmap timeout-salvage fix above only addresses losing results on a single scan's
  timeout. Hellfire's `injection_agent.py` still has no retry/backoff when its sqlmap loop
  hits Tengu's per-tool rate limit (10 calls/min, `tengu.toml`) — it logs a failure and
  immediately tries the next URL inside the same exhausted window, cascading into
  near-total failure for the rest of a batch on sites with many real parameterised
  endpoints. Not a Tengu-side fix; belongs in `injection_agent.py`'s `_run_sqlmap` loop.

## [0.4.0] — Code Quality and DX Improvements

### Added

**Tool Pipeline Helper**
- `src/tengu/tools/pipeline.py` — `tool_pipeline()` function that encapsulates the full
  security pipeline (sanitize → allowlist → stealth → rate_limit → audit → execute),
  reducing ~20 lines of boilerplate per tool while preserving all security guarantees.
  Returns a `PipelineResult` with stdout, stderr, returncode, and duration_seconds.

**Shared Test Fixtures**
- `tests/conftest.py` — centralized fixtures (`mock_config`, `mock_ctx`, `mock_audit`,
  `mock_allowlist`, `_reset_singletons`) to reduce setup boilerplate across 90+ test files.
  Autouse `_reset_singletons` prevents state leakage between tests.

**Expanded Stealth Proxy Injection (5 new CLI tools + 1 env var)**
- `amass` — `-proxy` flag for subdomain enumeration
- `katana` — `-proxy` flag for web crawling
- `httpx` (CLI) — `-http-proxy` flag for HTTP probing
- `dalfox` — `--proxy` flag for XSS scanning
- `crlfuzz` — `-x` proxy flag for CRLF injection fuzzing
- `hydra` — `HYDRA_PROXY` env var via `get_proxy_env()` (no CLI flag support)

### Improved

- **`from __future__ import annotations`**: added to 24 `__init__.py` files for consistent
  forward compatibility across the codebase
- **Exception narrowing**: `tor_check.py` now catches `(httpx.RequestError, TimeoutError)`
  instead of bare `Exception`; `metasploit.py` catches `InvalidInputError` for `sanitize_target`
- **Test coverage**: 2643+ tests (up from 2562+), including 7 new pipeline tests and 8 new
  stealth injection tests
